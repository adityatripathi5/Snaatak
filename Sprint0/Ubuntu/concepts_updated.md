Introduction to Ubuntu
Brief History
Ubuntu, first released in October 2004 by Canonical Ltd., is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. Founded by Mark Shuttleworth, its name derives from the Nguni Bantu term meaning "humanity" or "I am because we are." Ubuntu releases occur every six months, with Long-Term Support (LTS) versions every two years, offering five years of support.
Why Ubuntu?

User-Friendly: Intuitive interface suitable for beginners and professionals.
Open-Source: Freely available with a large community for support.
Stability and Security: Regular updates and robust security features.
Versatility: Supports desktops, servers, cloud, and IoT devices.

What is Ubuntu?
Ubuntu is a Linux-based operating system combining a stable core with user-friendly tools. It uses the GNOME desktop environment (by default in 22.04) and supports a wide range of software via its package management system.

Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ("Jammy Jellyfish"), released on April 21, 2022, is a Long-Term Support version supported until April 2027. It features:

Linux Kernel 5.15
GNOME 42
Enhanced Wayland support
Improved hardware compatibility


Installation Guide
Pre-Installation Checks

System Requirements:
2 GHz dual-core processor
4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)
25 GB free disk space
USB drive or DVD for installation media


Backup Data: Save critical files to an external drive.
Download ISO: Get Ubuntu 22.04 LTS from ubuntu.com.
Create Bootable Media: Use tools like Rufus or Etcher to create a bootable USB.
Verify ISO: Check the ISO’s checksum to ensure integrity.
Check Hardware: Ensure compatibility with Ubuntu (e.g., GPU, Wi-Fi).

Installation Process

Boot from Media: Insert USB/DVD, restart, and select the boot device (adjust BIOS if needed).
Start Installation:
Choose "Try Ubuntu" or "Install Ubuntu."
Select language and keyboard layout.


Prepare Disk:
Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" or manual partitioning.
Allocate at least 25 GB for the root (/) partition.


Configure Settings:
Set time zone, username, and password.
Opt for automatic login (optional).


Install:
Follow the wizard to complete installation (takes ~10-20 minutes).
Restart when prompted.



Post-Installation Checks

Boot Verification: Ensure the system boots to Ubuntu.
Network Check: Verify internet connectivity (ping google.com).
Update System: Run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade.
Driver Installation: Install proprietary drivers (e.g., NVIDIA) via "Software & Updates."
Check Disk: Use df -h to confirm disk allocation.


Software Management
Software Installation
Software can be installed via:

Ubuntu Software Center: GUI for browsing and installing apps.
APT (Advanced Package Tool): Command-line tool (sudo apt install <package>).
Snap: Install Snap packages (sudo snap install <package>).
Flatpak: Alternative package system (flatpak install <package>).

Example: Install VLC:
sudo apt install vlc

Software Update
Updates refresh the package index to reflect the latest available versions:
sudo apt update

Difference Between Update and Upgrade

Update: Refreshes the list of available packages and their versions (sudo apt update).
Upgrade: Installs newer versions of installed packages (sudo apt upgrade).

Package Management
Ubuntu uses APT and DPKG for package management:

APT: Manages dependencies and repositories.
DPKG: Handles individual .deb package installations (sudo dpkg -i package.deb).
Repositories: Configured in /etc/apt/sources.list.

List installed packages:
dpkg -l

Purpose of Installing Packages
Packages provide software, libraries, or tools to extend functionality:

When to Install: To add new features (e.g., nginx for a web server) or dependencies.
Which Package: Depends on need (e.g., python3 for development, gimp for image editing).

Purpose of Update and Upgrade

Update: Ensures the system knows about the latest package versions.
Upgrade: Applies security patches, bug fixes, and feature improvements.

Offline Installation
For systems without internet:

Download Packages: Use another system to download .deb files and dependencies (apt download <package>).
Transfer Files: Copy to the target system via USB.
Install: Use sudo dpkg -i *.deb or sudo apt install ./package.deb (after copying to a local directory).
Resolve Dependencies: Manually install missing dependencies or use tools like apt-offline.


Service Management
Services (e.g., web servers, databases) are managed using systemd:

Start a Service: sudo systemctl start <service>
Enable on Boot: sudo systemctl enable <service>
Check Status: sudo systemctl status <service>
Stop a Service: sudo systemctl stop <service>

Example: Manage Apache web server:
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2


Key Concepts
Binary Installation
Binary installation involves running precompiled executables:

Download a binary (e.g., .bin or .AppImage).
Make it executable: chmod +x file.bin.
Run: ./file.bin.
Useful for software not in repositories (e.g., proprietary apps).

Configuration Files in /etc
The /etc directory stores system-wide configuration files:

Examples:
/etc/fstab: Filesystem mounting.
/etc/apt/sources.list: Software repositories.
/etc/ssh/sshd_config: SSH server settings.


Editing: Use sudo nano /etc/<file> with caution.

Systemd (/etc/systemd)
Systemd is Ubuntu’s init system for managing services and system processes:

Configuration: Stored in /etc/systemd (user configs) and /lib/systemd (system defaults).
Unit Files: Define services (.service), timers, and mounts.
Logs: View with journalctl.

Example: Create a custom service in /etc/systemd/system/myapp.service.
Software Management Overview
Ubuntu’s software ecosystem relies on:

Repositories: Centralized sources for packages.
Package Managers: APT, Snap, Flatpak.
Dependency Resolution: Automatically handled by APT.
Updates: Regular patches for security and stability.


Common Operations in Ubuntu

File Management:
Copy: cp source destination
Move: mv source destination
Delete: rm file


User Management:
Add user: sudo adduser username
Change password: sudo passwd username


Network Configuration:
Check IP: ip addr
Edit network settings: /etc/netplan/.


Process Management:
List processes: ps aux
Kill process: kill <pid>


Disk Management:
Check usage: df -h
List partitions: lsblk


Logs:
View system logs: journalctl -xe
Check specific service: journalctl -u <service>
