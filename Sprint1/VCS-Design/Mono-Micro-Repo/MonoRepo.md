## Introduction

This repository contains the documentation for **Monorepo** strategy for version control. A Monorepo ("mono" meaning single, "repo" meaning repository) is a version control strategy where source code for many distinct projects or components is stored in the same repository. This contrasts with the Multi-repo (often associated with microservices) approach where each project/service/component has its own dedicated repository.

## Why

A monorepo helps teams manage multiple projects in a single codebase, improving collaboration, consistency, and code reuse.

| **What We're Improving**              | **Why It Matters**                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Developer Experience             | Easier for developers to get started, work across projects, and follow standard workflows. |
|  Code Sharing                      | Makes it simple to share and reuse code (like libraries or modules) across different projects. |
|  Consistent Dependency Management  | All teams manage dependencies in the same way, reducing errors and version conflicts. |
|  Faster CI/CD                      | CI/CD pipelines can be standardized and optimized across all services in the repo. |
|  Team Collaboration                | Developers can see and contribute to each other's work more easily, improving teamwork. |

## Monorepo Key Features

A monorepo setup brings helpful features that improve how teams work with multiple projects in a single place:

| **Feature**                    | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Single Source of Truth      | All code lives in one repository, making it easier to find, search, and navigate. |
| Atomic Commits & Refactoring | Make changes across multiple projects in one commit and apply updates system-wide. |
| Simplified Dependency Management | Easier to handle internal dependencies using tools like workspaces or linking. |
| Unified Tooling            | Use consistent tools for linting, testing, building, and deploying.              |
| Code Visibility             | Developers can explore all projects easily within a centralized codebase.        |

## Advantages of Monorepo

Using a monorepo offers strong benefits for teams working on multiple services or apps:

| **Advantage**                | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy Code Sharing         | Reduces friction when sharing and reusing code between projects and teams.       |
| Better Collaboration      | Developers can contribute across projects more easily and spot opportunities to help. |
| Process Consistency       | Simplifies enforcement of shared standards and workflows across teams.          |

## Challenges / Disadvantages of Monorepo

While monorepos offer many benefits, they also introduce challenges that teams need to carefully manage as the codebase grows.

| Challenge                  | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tooling Complexity         | Requires investment in and maintenance of specialized tools to manage the scale of a monorepo.      |
| Build/Test Performance     | Without optimizations like caching and affected-logic detection, performance can degrade quickly.   |
| Scalability Concerns       | As the repo grows, Git operations (e.g., clone, pull) can become slower and more resource-intensive. |
| CI/CD Complexity           | Pipelines must be intelligently scoped to avoid unnecessary builds and deployments.                 |

## Typical Monorepo Workflow

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c5f9d46-0348-447e-81cd-63d75c1c4559)


| Step         | Action                                                                                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Clone     | Developers clone the single repository.                                                            |
| 2. Branch    | Create a feature branch from the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`).                           |
| 3. Develop   | Make changes across one or more projects/packages.                                                 |
| 4. Build/Test| Run affected builds/tests using monorepo tooling (e.g., `nx affected:build`).                      |
| 5. Commit    | Commit changes, ideally using conventional commit messages.                                        |
| 6. Push & PR | Push your branch and open a Pull Request. CI triggers on affected projects.                        |
| 7. Review    | Relevant code owners review changes across affected projects.                                      |
| 8. Merge     | Merge the PR into the main branch once approved and passing CI.                                    |
| 9. Deploy    | CI/CD deploys only the changed apps/services.                                                      |

## Best Practices for Monorepo Management

| Best Practice                | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adopt Specialized Tooling   | Use tools like Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, or Lerna for advanced task orchestration and caching.    |
| Optimize CI/CD              | Configure pipelines to run only on affected paths using monorepo-aware tooling.              |
| Implement Build Caching     | Enable local and remote caching to drastically reduce build and test times.                  |
| Enforce Code Ownership      | Use `CODEOWNERS` to assign responsibility and streamline pull request reviews.               |

## Conclusion

This POC confirms that a Monorepo can significantly enhance code sharing, consistency, and cross-team collaboration.  
However, it also introduces challenges around tooling complexity and build performance that must be carefully managed.  
We recommend proceeding with a pilot implementation using specialized tooling and adhering to established best practices.
