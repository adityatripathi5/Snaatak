### Introduction

A Pull Request (PR) is a way to ask for your code changes to be added to a project. It lets others on the team review your work, give feedback, and approve it before it becomes part of the main code. This helps teams work together and keep the project high quality.

| **Slow Responses**            | It can take time to get reviews, which can hold up progress.                                           |
| **Avoiding Improvements**     | Developers might skip cleaning up or improving code to keep pull requests short and easier to review.   |

### Best Practices

| **Best Practice** | **Description** | **In Practice** |
| :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Small & Focused Changes** | Make each pull request about one specific fix or feature. | Break big tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. Each PR should do one thing. |
| **Clear Explanations** | Tell people what your changes do and why.                 | Write a good title and description in your pull request. Link to related issues. |
| **Get Your Code Checked** | Ask teammates to review your code before merging.        | Tag specific people to review your pull request and give feedback.           |
| **Test Before You Submit** | Make sure your code works before submitting it.          | Run tests on your own computer first. Make sure automated checks pass.        |

### Conclusion
Pull requests help teams work better together by making it easier to review and improve code. When used regularly, they lead to better-quality software and faster development.
