## Introduction

The Employee API is a RESTful Application Programming Interface developed in Golang, crafted specifically for the management of employee details. This system incorporates ScyllaDB to serve as its main database and utilizes Redis to handle caching tasks. The API has been constructed using the Gin framework, ensuring rapid and scalable handling of REST-based operations.

## Objective

The Employee API functions as a Go-language microservice intended to oversee all data and processes related to employees within the OT-Microservices framework. It acts as a unified backend service dedicated to the storage and retrieval of employee information. As a platform-independent application, it can operate on numerous operating systems. Execution of this application necessitates the presence of the Go runtime environment.

## Data Storage & Caching Mechanisms

This microservice makes use of ScyllaDB and Redis to manage data storage and retrieval effectively. Each component fulfills a specific function within the application:

### 1. ScyllaDB Details

ScyllaDB serves as the principal persistent database for the Employee API. It is tasked with storing all fundamental employee-associated data, including employee particulars, locations, and job roles.

#### Rationale for ScyllaDB

ScyllaDB stands out as a high-performance NoSQL database compatible with Apache Cassandra. It is fine-tuned for achieving lower latencies and greater throughput, rendering it ideal for applications that demand swift data access, especially at scale. Its distributed design enables it to handle vast amounts of data spread across numerous nodes, thereby ensuring scalability, high uptime, and data permanence. Moreover, ScyllaDB's inherently fault-tolerant structure incorporates replication and data partitioning, providing robustness against system failures and preserving data integrity even when nodes are unavailable. This database was chosen for the Employee API to establish a dependable and efficient storage foundation capable of managing substantial data loads as the collection of employee records expands.

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [ScyllaDB Documentation](LINK).

### 2. Redis Details

Redis acts as an in-memory caching layer designed to boost performance by temporarily holding data that is frequently accessed.

#### Rationale for Redis

Operating entirely within system memory, Redis allows for exceptionally fast data retrieval, making it perfectly suited for caching. It helps lessen the burden on the main database by minimizing the frequency of repeated queries to ScyllaDB. Redis supports adaptable caching methods, like the Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy, ensuring that the cached data remains relevant. While its use is optional, incorporating Redis notably enhances API response durations, thereby increasing operational efficiency through the caching of commonly accessed information.

For comprehensive setup instructions, refer to the [Redis Documentation](LINK).

## Final Thoughts

The Employee API represents a solid microservice engineered to handle employee data as part of the OT Microservices architecture. It integrates effectively with the Attendance API and Salary API and depends on ScyllaDB for high-capacity data storage. By utilizing Redis for caching, Swagger for API documentation generation, and Prometheus for system monitoring, it maintains efficient functioning and scalability. This API is positioned to function as the central pillar for services concerning employees, offering ease of future expansion and maintenance.
