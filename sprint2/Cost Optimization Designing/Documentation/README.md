## Introduction

This document outlines the **Cost Optimization Designing** strategy for infrastructure hosted in the **AWS Cloud**, specifically tailored for the [OT-MICROSERVICES](https://github.com/OT-MICROSERVICES/) project. The goal is to reduce unnecessary cloud expenditure by designing and managing resources efficiently without compromising on performance, scalability, or reliability.

**Cost Optimization** in AWS involves analyzing and minimizing spend while ensuring that the system remains aligned with business needs. It is a core pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework and is essential for sustainable cloud usage.

## Why Cost Optimization?

* Prevent cost overruns and budget leaks.
* Improve resource utilization and ROI.
* Align infrastructure costs with actual workloads.
* Support scalability without waste.
* Make business forecasts more predictable.

## Advantages of Cost Optimization

| **Benefit**                | **Description**                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cost Savings**           | Reduce overall cloud bills significantly             |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Align resources with actual usage                    |
| **Scalability**            | Build cost-aware architectures that scale smartly    |
| **Security**               | Decommission unused services that may pose risks     |
| **Sustainability**         | Reduce carbon footprint by avoiding resource wastage |

## Best Practices

| **Practice**                                                               | **Description**                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Right-size EC2 and RDS instances** based on usage metrics                | Match instance types/sizes to workload needs to avoid overprovisioning |
| **Purchase Reserved Instances or Savings Plans** for predictable workloads | Commit to long-term usage for significant cost savings                 |
| **Apply Auto Scaling** for EC2 and ECS to match real-time demand           | Dynamically adjust capacity based on traffic or workload               |
| **Use Spot Instances** for stateless or non-critical workloads             | Reduce costs by using spare AWS compute capacity                       |
| **Decommission Idle Resources** (e.g., EBS volumes, unused IPs, ELBs)      | Remove unused infrastructure to eliminate waste                        |

## Conclusion

Cloud cost optimization is an ongoing discipline, not a one-time activity. By proactively monitoring resource utilization and adjusting architectures for efficiency, teams can significantly reduce AWS bills while maintaining performance and scalability.

> In our project, we will implement regular cost reviews, enforce budgets, and use a mix of **Savings Plans**, **Spot Instances**, and **Auto Scaling**. Idle resources will be cleaned up via automation scripts and observability tools like CloudWatch and Trusted Advisor.

This ensures a **cost-effective, scalable, and secure infrastructure** aligned with both technical and business goals.
